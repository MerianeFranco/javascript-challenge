# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 

* A basic HTML web page [index.html](StarterCode/index.html) was used.

* The UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects was the reference to write code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

A date form in the HTML document was used and a JavaScript code was written to listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
